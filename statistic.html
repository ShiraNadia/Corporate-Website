<p>
<style="font-family: Casteller;"> The Cotton T-shirt collection, made from organic cotton, currently has sales rate of 15%. This represents a significant decrease from its higher sales rate of 40% in June 2020. The drop might suggest a shift in consumer preferences or market saturation.

<p>
The Premium Linen line, crafted from high-quality linen, also has a current sale rate of 15%. This is down from a higher sales rate of 30% in June 2020. The decline could indicate a similar trend of changing consumer interests or increased competition.

<p>
The Jersey Premium collection, made from high-quality jersey fabric, has sales rate of 20%. This is a decrease from its 30% sales rate in June 2020. The reduction may point to evolving market trends or the impact of new product lines.

<p>
The STYMPLE x adidas collaboration, launched in 2022, features high-quality jersey fabric same as the Jersey Premium. This line has experienced a steady flow in sales, with the percentage only changing by ±3% every month. This stability suggests consistent consumer interest and a strong brand partnership.

<p>
The STYMPLE x Mickey Mouse collaboration, also introduced in 2022, is made from organic cotton. Sales for this collection have shown a steady flow, with the percentage changing by ±4% every month. This indicates a stable demand and effective marketing of the collaboration

<p>
The Cotton T-shirt collection, made from organic cotton, offers four colors: white (CT1), black (CT2), purple (CT3), and pink (CT4). The data reveals that the purple T-shirt (CT3) is the most popular among consumers, followed by black (CT2) and pink (CT4), which have equal sales. The white T-shirt (CT1) is the least purchased, indicating a preference for more vibrant and less traditional colors. Future plans to introduce a wider variety of colors could potentially boost sales further, especially if they align with the trending color preferences seen in the current data.

<p>
The Premium Linen range features high-quality linen in four colors: dark grey (PL1), light brown (PL2), light blue (PL3), and soft gold (PL4). Light brown (PL2) is the top seller, suggesting a strong consumer inclination towards earthy and neutral tones. Dark grey (PL1) and soft gold (PL4) share the second spot in sales, highlighting a balanced appeal for both classic and unique colors. The light blue (PL3) linen is the least purchased, indicating a lesser demand for lighter hues in this fabric. Plans to expand the color range could capitalize on the current trends, potentially enhancing overall sales.

<p>
The Jersey Premium line, made from high-quality jersey fabric, is available in blue (JP1), yellow with black stripes (JP2), light purple (JP3), and lime green (JP4). Light purple (JP3) stands out as the most purchased color, suggesting a consumer preference for softer, pastel shades in jersey fabric. Blue (JP1) and lime green (JP4) are equally favored, reflecting a demand for both classic and vibrant colors. The yellow with black stripes (JP2) is the least popular, possibly due to its bold and specific design. Expanding the color options could attract a broader audience, accommodating varying tastes and preferences.

<p>
The STYMPLE x adidas collaboration, introduced in 2022, features high-quality jersey fabric in black with white stripes (SA1), white with black stripes (SA2), light purple with black stripes (SA3), and light yellow with white stripes (SA4). The black with white stripes (SA1) variant is the most purchased, indicating a strong consumer preference for classic, athletic aesthetics. White with black stripes (SA2) and light yellow with white stripes (SA4) are equally popular, suggesting an appreciation for both traditional and softer color combinations. Light purple with black stripes (SA3) is the least purchased, indicating a lesser demand for this specific color combination. Future designs will likely build on the successful elements of the current collection.

<p>
The STYMPLE x Mickey Mouse collaboration, launched in 2022, features organic cotton T-shirts in white (SM1), black (SM2), purple (SM3), and pink (SM4). The purple (SM3) T-shirt is the top seller, indicating a strong preference for this color. Black (SM2) and pink (SM4) share the second spot in sales, reflecting a balanced demand for both neutral and vibrant options. The white T-shirt (SM1) is the least purchased, consistent with the trend seen in the regular Cotton T-shirt collection. With plans to introduce additional designs, the collaboration is poised to attract even more fans of both STYMPLE and Mickey Mouse, potentially increasing overall sales.
